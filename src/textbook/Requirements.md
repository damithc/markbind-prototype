# Requirements

> <seg def-Requirement> **Requirement** : A requirement specifies needs of stakeholders that are to be met 
  by software. </seg>

A development project may aim to replace or update an established software system 
(called a brown-field project) or it may aim to develop a totally new system with no precedent 
(called a green-field project). In either case, the stakeholders’ needs and expectations 
have to be understood, discussed, refined, clarified, scoped or re-scoped. Identifying users’ 
requirements is not as straightforward as it sounds. It is not as simple as writing a wish list. 
 
There are two different kinds of requirements: functional requirements and non-functional requirements.

There are two requirements-related activities that go hand-in-hand:
1. **Establishing requirements**:  <include EstablishingRequirements.md#Preview/>
2. **Specifying requirements**:  <include SpecifyingRequirements.md#Preview/>

> **Requirements specification vs system specification**<br>
  A requirement specification contains the needs of the user to be fulfilled or the problem to be solved. 
  A system specification contains how the system will fulfill those requirements. In some projects, 
  these two are done together. For example, the user might specify what needs to be built (i.e. system specification) 
  instead of specifying what problem need to be solved.
