# Requirements

> <seg def-Requirement> **Requirement** : A requirement specifies needs of stakeholders that are to be met 
  by software. </seg>

A development project may aim to replace or update an established software system 
(called a brown-field project) or it may aim to develop a totally new system with no precedent 
(called a green-field project). In either case, the stakeholders’ needs and expectations 
have to be understood, discussed, refined, clarified, scoped or re-scoped. Identifying users’ 
requirements is not as straightforward as it sounds. It is not as simple as writing a wish list. 
 
There are two different kinds of requirements: functional requirements and non-functional requirements.

There are two requirements-related activities that go hand-in-hand:
1. **Establishing requirements**: Requirements gathering, requirements elicitation, requirements analysis, 
   requirements capture are some of the terms commonly and interchangeably used to represent the activity 
   of understanding what a software product should do. 
2. **Specifying requirements**: As we establish requirements, they should be recorded in some way for future reference, 
   usually called a requirement specification. Furthermore, it is advisable to show these requirements to stakeholders, 
   and refine requirements based on their feedback. The next phase is to convert requirements into a product 
   specification that specifies how the product will address the requirements. 

> **Requirements specification vs system specification**<br>
  A requirement specification contains the needs of the user to be fulfilled or the problem to be solved. 
  A system specification contains how the system will fulfill those requirements. In some projects, 
  these two are done together. For example, the user might specify what needs to be built (i.e. system specification) 
  instead of specifying what problem need to be solved.

## Establishing requirements 
There are many techniques used during a requirements gathering. The following are some of the techniques.

### Brainstorming  
Brainstorming is a group activity designed to generate a large number of diverse and creative ideas for the solution 
of a problem. In a brainstorming session there are no "bad" ideas. 
The aim is to generate ideas; not to validate them. Brainstorming encourages you to "think outside the box" and 
put "crazy" ideas on the table without fear of rejection.

### User surveys
Carefully designed questionnaires can be used to solicit responses and opinions from a large number of users regarding 
any current system or a new innovation.

### Observation 
Observation of users in their natural work environment is a common technique used to understand the tasks and the 
environment of the user. Interaction logging on an existing system can also be used to gather information about how 
an existing system is being used. 

### Interviews 
Interviewing potential stakeholders and domain experts can give us useful information about a domain. 
Interview is a good technique at getting users to explore what users feel about the required system.  
Interviews also provide opportunities for the development team members to meet stakeholders and to make 
stakeholders feel involved in the development process.

### Focus groups  
Focus groups are a kind of informal interview within an interactive group setting. A group of people 
(e.g. potential users, beta testers) are asked about their understanding of a specific issue or a process.  
Focus groups can bring out undiscovered conflicts and misunderstandings among stakeholder interests which can then be 
resolved or clarified as necessary.
