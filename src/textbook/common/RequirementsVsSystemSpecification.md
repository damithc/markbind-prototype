<h1>Requirements specification vs system specification</h1>

A requirement specification contains the needs of the user to be fulfilled or the problem to be solved. 
A system specification contains how the system will fulfill those requirements. In some projects, 
these two are done together. For example, the user might specify what needs to be built (i.e. system specification) 
instead of specifying what problem need to be solved.
