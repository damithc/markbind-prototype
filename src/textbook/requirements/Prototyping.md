#Prototyping
A prototype is a mock up, a scaled down version, or a partial system constructed 

1. to get usersâ€™ feedback. 
2. to validate a technical concept (a "proof-of-concept" prototype).
3. to give a preview of what is to come, or to compare multiple alternatives on a 
    small scale before committing fully to one alternative. 
4. for early field-testing under controlled conditions.

Early UI prototyping, i.e. sketching the user interface for the intended product, is a good technique 
to uncover requirements, in particular, those related to how users interact with the system. 
UI prototypes are often used in brainstorming sessions, or in meetings with the users to get quick feedback from them.

(a tool for creating UI prototypes)
