In <info ../common/Definitions.md#GreenfieldProject>_greenfield projects_</info> as well as in 
<info ../common/Definitions.md#BrownfieldProject>_brownfield projects_</info> the stakeholdersâ€™ needs and expectations 
have to be understood, discussed, refined, clarified, 
<info ../common/Definitions.md#Scope>scoped</info> or re-scoped. 

Dealing with requirements is a complicated task. It is not as simple as writing a wish list.

Note that when dealing with requirements, we need to consider both functional requirements and 
non-functional requirements.

There are two requirements-related activities that go hand-in-hand:

1. **Establishing requirements**:  <include EstablishingRequirements.md#Preview/>

2. **Specifying requirements**:  <include SpecifyingRequirements.md#Preview/>
