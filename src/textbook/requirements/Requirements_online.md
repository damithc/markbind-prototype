<info ../common/Definitions.md#BrownfieldProject>_brownfield projects_</info> the stakeholdersâ€™ needs and expectations 
have to be understood, discussed, refined, clarified, 
<info ../common/Definitions.md#Scope>scoped</info> or re-scoped.

Note that when dealing with requirements, we need to consider both functional requirements and 
non-functional requirements.

1. **Establishing requirements**:  <include EstablishingRequirements.md#preview/>
2. **Specifying requirements**:  <include SpecifyingRequirements.md#preview/>
